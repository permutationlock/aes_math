AES + Galois Theory Project
---------------------------

Alright, so after doing a bunch of galois multiply and modulus
calculations by hand, I have everything figured out and have
a GaloisPolynomial class that does the correct operations for
addition and multiplication with modulus.

NOTE: This was a headache and took me WAY longer than planned...

Obviously this was not necessary for AES, but I wanted to do
it to try and better show the math and just be different from
the other AES projects.  My class also works for any Galois
Polynomials, not just GF(2^8).

Going forward from here I have a very clear picture of how to
use these operations to apply the transformations for AES
Sub Bytes, Shift Rows and Mix Columns (mix columns is the only
one that really uses any Galois operations).

For my project I guess I will be a bit half research and half
implementation.  I will discuss why AES works and is secure,
how Galois Field arithmetic works, etc...
